### Hello, I'm Mikolaj ğŸ‘‹

I'm an independent software and infrastructure engineer and I have been a computer enthusiast since 1992.  Throughout that time I had an opportunity to grasp whole spectrum of different aspects in creating IT systems.  However, it's writing software that gives me the greatest joy.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various web3 projects, set of own devops and kubernetes tools and some old hobby projects such as a javascript based graphic editor
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Ziglang, as well as exploring Web3 and AI space
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting project
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: g@f0x.pl
